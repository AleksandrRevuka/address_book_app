The code provided is a Python application that represents an address book. It uses the npyscreen library to create a text-based user interface for interacting with the address book.

The main components of the code are:

The AddressBookApp class: This is the main application class derived from npyscreen.NPSAppManaged. It sets up the theme, reads records from a file, and adds forms to the application.

The MainForm class: This class represents the main form of the address book. It displays a list of contacts and provides menu options for adding, editing, and deleting contacts.

The EditContactForm, DeleteContactForm, and AddContactForm classes: These classes represent the forms for editing, deleting, and adding contacts, respectively. They define the layout of the forms and handle user interactions.

The code follows an object-oriented approach, where each form is defined as a separate class with its own methods and attributes.
